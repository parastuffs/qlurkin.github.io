<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For the purposes of mobility and sustainable development, a research
project focused on analyzing <strong>traffic in Brussels</strong> will
be initiated. To collect data, Brussels’ <strong>ANPR camera
network</strong> will be enhanced, and the data produced will be
<strong>centralized</strong> for analysis. These cameras are capable of
recognizing license plates as well as various characteristics of
vehicles.</p>
<p>As part of this analysis, a number of <strong>metrics</strong> will
need to be computed based on the data. These metrics will have to be
computed <strong>as the data arrives</strong>, allowing for easy
analysis of their evolution.</p>

<h2>Microservices</h2>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of software development and modern
application design, <strong>microservice architecture</strong> has
emerged as a transformative paradigm, revolutionizing the way we build
and maintain <strong>complex systems</strong>. As organizations strive
for <strong>agility</strong>, <strong>scalability</strong>, and the
ability to <strong>adapt</strong> swiftly to changing market dynamics,
microservices have become a fundamental approach for achieving these
objectives.</p>
<p>At its core, microservice architecture is a design pattern that
structures an application as a <strong>collection</strong> of
<strong>small</strong>, loosely coupled, and
<strong>independently</strong> deployable services. Unlike traditional
monolithic applications, where all functionalities are tightly
integrated into a single codebase, microservices break down complex
systems into a network of smaller, <strong>self-contained
components</strong>, each responsible for a specific business
capability.</p>
<p>This architectural approach brings numerous benefits, including
enhanced <strong>flexibility, scalability, and maintainability</strong>.
Each microservice operates as a standalone entity, often with its own
database and APIs, enabling development teams to work independently on
different services. This decoupling of services fosters parallel
development, enabling <strong>faster</strong> release cycles and the
ability to respond rapidly to <strong>changing requirements</strong> or
customer feedback.</p>
<p>The advantages of microservices extend beyond development. Operations
teams benefit from <strong>simpler deployment</strong> and monitoring,
as each service can be <strong>updated or scaled independently</strong>
without affecting the entire application. Fault isolation and recovery
are also improved, as issues in one service are less likely to cascade
throughout the entire system.</p>
</section>
<section id="architecture" class="level2">
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Here are the services that will make up the system :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Map</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the graph of the map.</li>
<li>Compute the shortest path between points.</li>
<li>API for map updates (roadworks, one-way street, road closure, new
road, etc.).</li>
<li>Cache relevant results to avoid redundant computations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>ANPR</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store events from ANPR cameras.</li>
<li>Ping cameras for health checks.</li>
<li>API to add or remove cameras.</li>
<li>Ensure that only registered cameras can send data to your
service.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Metrics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add or remove metrics to compute over time.</li>
<li>Compute the metrics.</li>
<li>Store the computed data.</li>
<li>Ensure security when executing client code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="your-work" class="level2">
<h2>Your Work</h2>
<p>You will work in groups of two.</p>
<p>You’ll be part of a <strong>development team</strong> responsible for
one of these microservices.</p>
<p>You will:</p>
<ul>
<li>meet with other teams to identify data flows and design <strong>API
specifications</strong>,</li>
<li>develop your service with a suitable frontend,</li>
<li>ensure quality through <strong>unit testing</strong>,</li>
<li>store the <strong>data</strong> for which you are responsible,</li>
<li>account for the unavailability of other services,</li>
<li>produce all the necessary documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also act as the <strong>administrator of a Kubernetes
Cluster</strong> <em>(your Minikube installation)</em> that will run the
entire system. In this role, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>pull all services to <strong>deploy</strong> them on your
cluster,</li>
<li>ensure that services can <strong>communicate</strong> with each
other within the cluster,</li>
<li>expose all frontends and external APIs through a
<strong>proxy</strong> like Traefik, nginx, or Apache,</li>
<li><strong>monitor</strong> load and <strong>scale</strong> services
individually,</li>
<li>perform <strong>updates</strong> to services individually without
service interruption.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="evaluation" class="level2">
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>The evaluation will occur in several stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3 <strong>progress presentations</strong> and a final
presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st presentation <em>(October 8 PM, 13% of the points)</em>:
<ul>
<li>Have a trivial service usable by cluster administrators.</li>
<li>Deploy all services on your cluster and make them accessible via the
proxy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2nd presentation <em>(13% of the points)</em>: details to be
determined.</li>
<li>3rd presentation <em>(13% of the points)</em>: details to be
determined.</li>
<li>Final presentation <em>(December 10 PM, 36% of the
points)</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Git repository</strong> <em>(25% of the points)</em>
containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code for your service.</li>
<li>The files necessary for deployment on Kubernetes.</li>
<li>Complete API documentation.</li>
<li>A report describing the methods used and issues encountered.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
