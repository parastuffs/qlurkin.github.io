    <h1>Lab 1 <small>Getting started with Docker</small></h1>
    
    <h2>Organisation</h2>
<p><strong>Mandatory Attendance:</strong> The project requires collaboration among students, which is only possible if you are present.</p>
<p>The activities <strong>AC5L-L1: Distributed Systems Project 1</strong> and <strong>AD5L-L1: Distributed Systems Project 2</strong> are dedicated to the same project. Therefore, you have a total of 14 lab sessions.</p>
<p>Labs 1 and 2 are dedicated to exploring Docker and Kubernetes tools. <strong>The project statement will be provided in Lab 3</strong>.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>When creating an application on your development computer, everything generally works well. It&#39;s when you send it to <strong>someone else</strong> or run it on the <strong>production server</strong> that problems start to arise. This is because these machines are configured differently (OS, applications, libraries, etc.).</p>
<h2>Container</h2>
<p>The use of containers is a solution to this problem. A container is a <strong>virtualization of an operating system</strong>. It is a much lighter solution than a virtual machine, which virtualizes the hardware and requires installing a full operating system as well as the application&#39;s dependencies, and this for each application you want to run on the host machine.</p>
<p>There are three essential elements when using Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dockerfile</strong>: It is a list of instructions used to build an image.</li>
<li><strong>Image</strong>: It is a snapshot of the state of your application and all its dependencies at a specific point in time. An image is immutable and can be used to create multiple containers.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: It is an instance of the execution of the virtual operating system with your application and its dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example of Dockerfile:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-dockerfile"># Use the official Ubuntu image as the base image
FROM ubuntu:24.04

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src

# Install Python and pip
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip.

# Expose the port 8000 for your app
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run your app
CMD [&quot;python3&quot;, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;http.server&quot;, &quot;8000&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h3>Building an image:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">docker build -t myapp ./
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-t</code> option allows you to specify the image name <em>(tag name)</em>, and the path at the end of the command indicates where to find the Dockerfile.</p>
<h3>Start a container:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">docker run myapp
</code></pre>
<p>This command will use the <code>myapp</code> image to create and start a container.</p>
<h3>Examine the containers that are currently running:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">docker ps
</code></pre>
