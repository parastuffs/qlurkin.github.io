    <h1>Project 2023 <small>ECAMazon</small></h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce, the pursuit of excellence knows no bounds. It is with great enthusiasm and ambition that we embark on a monumental journey: <strong>the creation of the world&#39;s largest online shop</strong>. This project represents a visionary endeavor that seeks to redefine the way people shop, connect with products, and experience the digital marketplace.</p>
<p>In the dynamic and ever-evolving realm of e-commerce, the concept of <strong>scalability</strong> stands as a cornerstone of <strong>success</strong>. The ability of an IT infrastructure to scale efficiently and effectively is not merely a technical consideration but a strategic imperative for any online shop aiming to become the <strong>largest in the world</strong>. Scalability is the lifeline that ensures your platform can not only meet <strong>current demands</strong> but also grow and adapt to <strong>future needs</strong> seamlessly.</p>
<h2>Microservices</h2>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of software development and modern application design, <strong>the microservice architecture</strong> has emerged as a transformative paradigm that has revolutionized the way we build and maintain <strong>complex systems</strong>. As organizations strive for <strong>agility</strong>, <strong>scalability</strong>, and the ability to <strong>adapt</strong> swiftly to changing market dynamics, microservices have become a fundamental approach for achieving these objectives.</p>
<p>At its core, microservice architecture is a design pattern that structures an application as a <strong>collection</strong> of <strong>small</strong>, loosely coupled, and <strong>independently</strong> deployable services. Unlike traditional monolithic applications, where all functionalities are tightly integrated into a single codebase, microservices break down complex systems into a network of smaller, <strong>self-contained components</strong>, each responsible for a specific business capability.</p>
<p>This architectural approach brings a multitude of benefits, including enhanced <strong>flexibility, scalability, and maintainability</strong>. Each microservice operates as a standalone entity, often with its own database and APIs, enabling development teams to work independently on different services. This decoupling of services fosters parallel development, enabling <strong>faster</strong> release cycles and the ability to respond rapidly to <strong>changing requirements</strong> or customer feedback.</p>
<p>The advantages of microservices extend beyond development. Operations teams benefit from <strong>easier deployment</strong> and monitoring, as each service can be <strong>updated or scaled independently</strong> without affecting the entire application. Fault isolation and recovery are also improved, as issues in one service are less likely to cascade throughout the entire system.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stock</strong>: manages warehousemen, stock quantities, storage depots and parcel creation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Shop</strong>: manages prices, promo codes (vouchers, gift cards, etc.), product classification (categories, recommendations, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Users</strong>: manages user&#39;s personal informations, addresses and payment methods.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Payment</strong>: in connection with banks, manages payments, refunds, validation of payment methods and user&#39;s credits.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Shipping</strong>: manages sent and returned parcels and their complete traceability.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dispatching</strong>: manages delivery drivers, sorting centers, delivery vehicles, their geolocation and delivery rounds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Work</h2>
<p>You&#39;ll be part of a development team taking charge of one of these microservices.</p>
<p>You will :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>meet with other teams to identify data flows and design <strong>API specifications</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li><p>develop your service with a relevant frontend,</p>
</li>
<li><p>ensure quality through <strong>unit testing</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li><p>adopt a <strong>continuous integration</strong> solution,</p>
</li>
<li><p>be able to <strong>monitor</strong> the load of your service in production,</p>
</li>
<li><p>store the <strong>data</strong> for which you are responsible,</p>
</li>
<li><p>set up and document a procedure for <strong>scaling</strong> your service that can be automated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The unavailability of other services must be taken into account.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p><strong>Your Kubernetes infrastructure will soon be available</strong></p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>All the services must be in production for testing for the last lab. CI, monitoring and Scaling will be tested.</p>
<p>You must produce a report that follow this structure: Introduction, Materials and methods, Results, Discussion.</p>
