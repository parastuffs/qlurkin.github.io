    "- Find the transfer function linking the current $I_6(s)$ through the inductance L to the input voltage $U_s(s)$ and check the duration of the transient. This is done on the basis of Kirchhoff's equations (previously obtained in exercise exo_circuit_phaseurs_1) and a matrix inversion but this time via dynamic systems and no longer complex impedances. For example : using phasors, the current in a capacitor is written $I_c = i \\omega C U_c$; using dynamical system: $I_c = s C U_c$ (with $s$; the Laplacian operator).\n",
    "- Using the Bode diagram, check the steady state current obtained for the input voltage defined above.\n",
    "- Represent the signal of the source voltage and that of the current (in transient and established state) in the coil as a function of time, on 2 complete periods, with 1000 points, and the same formatting as the graph below.\n",
    "- Then observe the index response of this circuit (input step: $U_s$, output = 0)\n",
    "- Draw the bode diagram of the answer (input: $U_s$; output: $U_L$)\n",
